    this provides the layout for the grid. normally layout handles in magento
    have much more content than this however the admin works in such a way
    that the layout handles only deal with the high level parents, so here
    we are creating a grid container and that is it - the grid container
    class code then creates the grid as a child of itself, and the grid
    creates headers, rows, columns etc - basically layout is done
    programmatically rather than via xml
